P009022_1,"The 1921 yearbook — Volume 1 of Evergreen and Gold — was hardbound with a horizontal orientation.

P009022_14,"The volume is of unprecedented richness, with a distinctive embossed cover, bold illustrations, attractive end papers, and a color-tinted photograph as a frontispiece. Throughout the book, there is a new sophistication. Its pages are bigger — about 22 centimetres by 31 centimetres –— and are oriented vertically, establishing the standard for the rest of the publication's life. Although there are almost 300 pages, the lengthy grad profiles disappear, no longer practical because of the larger student numbers.",Evergreen and Gold Vol. 14 (1934),1934,https://archive.org/details/P009022_14,item,University of Alberta,53.52646,-113.5256,https://archive.org/services/img/P009022_14

N035684,"A milestone edition of the yearbook was published in 1966. rethinking resulted in their devoting almost half the book to a photo-essay recalling, month-by-month, the events and activities of the University year. Gone are the rigidly-staged group photos; over-all the yearbook is lively and engaging, organic rather than stratified. In those days the Students' Union Building had just been built.

N035688,"New campus culture is evident in the 1970 yearbook — the last Evergreen and Gold in the traditional mould. It's a brash, in-your-face publication with bold photography and a we-don't-give-a-damn attitude (not even, apparently, about spelling). But for all the life that characterized Evergreen and Gold in 1970, it would soon disappear.
In the spring of 1970 the Students' Union decided that the money being poured into the yearbook — by that time, about $40,000 per year — could be better spent and decided to pull its support.

P009022_51,"Eventually, there was a yearbook published in 1971, but it makes no attempt to be a chronicle of the year's events and activities. It is a strange publication, organized into two small volumes and entitled Who's Who at the factory. One of the volumes contains only names and photos of the graduates, which are separated by title pages containing the names of the faculties and schools — there are no other words, no introductory text, no page numbers, nothing else. The 64-page companion volume (which came complete with a fold-out psychedelic poster) is an esoteric mix of photography, cartoons, interviews, free verse, and other forms of literary expression.",Evergreen and Gold Vol 51: Who's Who at the Factory - Interviews Photographs and Articles (1971),1971,https://archive.org/details/P009022_51,item,University of Alberta,53.52646,-113.5256,https://archive.org/services/img/P009022_51
N035689,"There wasn't another volume of Evergreen and Gold published until 1983-84. In that year, the University's 75th anniversary year, a group of interested students led by Michael Ford, '81 BCom, '85 LLB, attempted to revive the yearbook and produced Volume 52 of Evergreen and Gold.
