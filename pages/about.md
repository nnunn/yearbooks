<h1>About the University of Alberta Yearbooks </h1>
Welcome to our online yearbook collection, a rich resource for researchers to learn about a unique view of student life, learning, and research as it unfolded through the years. Beyond the graduation portraits and club photos, you'll also find advertisements from local businesses, offering a glimpse into the community that supported the university.

You can easily browse the yearbooks chronologically or by campus location to find the faces and stories you're looking for. 

When you have found the yearbook you want to read, you can also use the magnifying glass icon on the left side of the screen to search the text within each book. This makes it simple to pinpoint specific names, events, or themes.

Are you curious to see these pieces of history in person? By request, most yearbooks are available for viewing in the University Archives reading room. We invite you to explore this collection and uncover the memories and moments captured within its pages.
